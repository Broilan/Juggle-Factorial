# Juggle Factorial

Jiggle Factorial is a JavaScript-based game designed to mimic Brain HQ's "Juggle Factor," which measures and improves multitasking ability, processing speed, working memory, and attention.

## How to Play

1. **Select Settings**: Choose your desired settings and save them.
2. **Start the Game**: Click start to begin the game.
3. **Observe the Balls**: You'll see a set of uniquely colored balls, and some will be marked with numbers, one at a time, before reverting to their original state.
4. **Select the Balls**: After some time, the balls will freeze, and you'll select them according to whether you've selected the forwards or backwards span.
5. **Advance Levels**: After selecting the balls, a new, performance-adjusted level will begin.

## Settings
